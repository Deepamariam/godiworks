                Life is full of changes, big or small. Nothing stays the same. And everyday 
                take a moment to stop, think and thank for all the blessings in this big world. Feel happy, proud and content. 
                No matter wherever you go or whatever happens, know well that you are gifted.

                Do not be afraid to let go. Close your eyes, open your heart, clear your mind. Let go of everything that is 
                weighing you down. New beginnings, new hopes, new concepts. Always make a room for something new. 
                Never be afraid to try something new, because life gets boring when you stay within the limits of what you already know.

                The world can seem massive and discouraging, but don't let this stop you from discovering
                the bliss and beauty. When you make a mistake there are only three things you should ever do about it: admit it, learn from it, and don't repeat it.
